/* Explanation:

In the code you provided from your db.js file, you have two exported functions: connectToDb and getDb. Let's break down what each of these functions does:

connectToDb Function:

This function is designed to establish a connection to your MongoDB database. It uses await MongoClient.connect(...) to connect to the MongoDB server using the provided connection string.
If the connection is successful, it assigns the database reference to the dbconn variable.
If there is any error during the connection, it logs the error and throws it.

This function is asynchronous (async) because connecting to a database involves asynchronous operations like establishing a network connection. It uses await to wait for the connection to be established before proceeding.

getDb Function:

This function is a simple getter function that returns the value of the dbconn variable.
dbconn is expected to be set when the connectToDb function is called and the connection is successfully established.

This function is synchronous and returns the database reference stored in dbconn.

Now, regarding how the promise is getting resolved:

When you call connectToDb, it returns a promise implicitly due to the use of async. You can use await or .then() to wait for this promise to resolve.

Inside connectToDb, the actual promise resolution happens when the await MongoClient.connect(...) call completes successfully or when an error is thrown. If the connection is successful, the promise resolves with the connected database client, allowing you to call getDb afterward to access the database.

In this example, the await connectToDb() call ensures that the database connection is established before you attempt to retrieve the database with getDb(). This pattern is often used to ensure that the database is ready for use before interacting with it in your application.
